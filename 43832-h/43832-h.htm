<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the word Germany comes to our
minds, we think at once of ruined castles,
fairies, music, and soldiers. Why is it?</p>

<p>First, as to the castles. Here and there
along the banks of the River Rhine, as well
as elsewhere throughout the country, the traveller
is constantly finding himself near some
massive stone ruin. It seems ever ready to
tell stories of long ago,&mdash;of brave knights
who defended its walls, of beautiful princesses
saved from harm, of sturdy boys and sweet-faced
girls who once played in its gardens.
For Germany is the home of an ancient and
brave people, who have often been called
upon to face powerful enemies.</p>

<p>Next, as to the fairies. It seems as though
the dark forests of Germany, the quiet valleys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and the banks of the beautiful rivers, were the
natural homes of the fairy-folk, the gnomes
and the elves, the water-sprites and the sylphs.
Our German cousins listen with wonder and
delight to the legends of fearful giants and
enchanted castles, and many of the stories they
know so well have been translated into other
languages for their cousins of distant lands,
who are as fond of them as the blue-eyed
children of Germany.</p>

<p>As to the music, it seems as though every
boy and girl in the whole country drew in the
spirit of song with the air they breathe. They
sing with a love of what they are singing, they
play as though the tune were a part of their
very selves. Some of the finest musicians
have been Germans, and their gifts to the
world have been bountiful.</p>

<p>As for soldiers, we know that every man in
Germany must stand ready to defend his country.
He must serve his time in drilling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
training for war. He is a necessary part of
that Fatherland he loves so dearly.</p>

<p>Our fair-haired German cousins are busy
workers and hard students. They must learn
quite early in life that they have duties as well
as pleasures, and the duties cannot be set aside
or forgotten. But they love games and holidays
as dearly as the children of our own
land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>CHRISTMAS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Don't</span> look! There, now it's done!"
cried Bertha.</p>

<p>It was two nights before Christmas. Bertha
was in the big living-room with her mother
and older sister. Each sat as close as possible
to the candle-light, and was busily working on
something in her lap.</p>

<p>But, strange to say, they did not face each
other. They were sitting back to back.</p>

<p>"What an unsociable way to work," we
think. "Is that the way Germans spend the
evenings together?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>No, indeed. But Christmas was near at
hand, and the air was brimful of secrets.</p>

<p>Bertha would not let her mother discover
what she was working for her, for all the
world. And the little girl's mother was preparing
surprises for each of the children. All
together, the greatest fun of the year was getting
ready for Christmas.</p>

<p>"Mother, you will make some of those
lovely cakes this year, won't you?" asked
Bertha's sister Gretchen.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my child. It would not be
Christmas without them. Early to-morrow
morning, you and Bertha must shell and chop
the nuts. I will use the freshest eggs and will
beat the dough as long as my arms will let
me."</p>

<p>"Did you always know how to make those
cakes, mamma?" asked Bertha.</p>

<p>"My good mother taught me when I was
about your age, my dear. You may watch me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to-morrow, and perhaps you will learn how to
make them. It is never too early to begin
to learn to cook."</p>

<p>"When the city girls get through school,
they go away from home and study housekeeping
don't they?" asked Gretchen.</p>

<p>"Yes, and many girls who don't live in
cities. But I hardly think you will ever be
sent away. We are busy people here in our
little village, and you will have to be contented
with learning what your mother can teach
you.</p>

<p>"I shall be satisfied with that, I know.
But listen! I can hear father and Hans
coming."</p>

<p>"Then put up your work, children, and set
the supper-table."</p>

<p>The girls jumped up and hurriedly put the
presents away. It did not take long to set the
supper-table, for the meals in this little home
were very simple, and supper was the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of all. A large plate of black bread and a
pitcher of sour milk were brought by the
mother, and the family gathered around the
table.</p>

<p>The bread wasn't really black, of course.
It was dark brown and very coarse. It was
made of rye meal. Bertha and Gretchen had
never seen any white bread in their lives, for
they had never yet been far away from their
own little village. Neither had their brother
Hans.</p>

<p>They were happy, healthy children. They
all had blue eyes, rosy cheeks, and fair hair,
like their father and mother.</p>

<p>"You don't know what I've got for you,
Hans," said Bertha, laughing and showing a
sweet little dimple in her chin.</p>

<p>Hans bent down and kissed her. He never
could resist that dimple, and Bertha was his
favourite sister.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is, but I do know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that it must be something nice," said her
brother.</p>

<p>When the supper-table had been cleared,
the mother and girls took out their sewing
again, while Hans worked at some wood-carving.
The father took an old violin from
its case and began to play some of the beautiful
airs of Germany.</p>

<p>When he came to the "Watch on the
Rhine," the mother's work dropped from her
hands as she and the children joined in the
song that stirs every German heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! it seems as though Christmas
Eve never would come," sighed Bertha, as she
settled herself for sleep beside her sister.</p>

<p>It was quite a cold night, but they were
cosy and warm. Why shouldn't they be?
They were covered with a down feather bed.
Their mother had the same kind of cover on
her own bed, and so had Hans.</p>

<p>But Christmas Eve did come at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
although it seemed so far off to Bertha the
night before. Hans and his father brought in
the bough of a yew-tree, and it was set up
in the living-room.</p>

<p>The decorating came next. Tiny candles
were fastened on all the twigs. Sweetmeats
and nuts were hung from the branches.</p>

<p>"How beautiful! How beautiful!" exclaimed
the children when it was all trimmed,
and they walked around it with admiring eyes.</p>

<p>None of the presents were placed on the
tree, for that is not the fashion in Germany.
Each little gift had been tied up in paper and
marked with the name of the one for whom it
was intended.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, there was a
moment of quiet while the candles were being
lighted. Then Bertha's father began to give
out the presents, and there was a great deal of
laughing and joking as the bundles were
opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a new red skirt for Bertha. Her
mother had made it, for she knew the child
was fond of pretty dresses. Besides this, she
had a pair of warm woollen mittens which
Gretchen had knit for her. Hans had made
and carved a doll's cradle for each of the girls.</p>

<p>Everybody was happy and contented. They
sang songs and cracked nuts and ate the Christmas
cakes to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>"I think I like the ones shaped like gnomes
the best," said Hans. "They have such comical
little faces. Do you know, every time
I go out in the forest, it seems as though I
might meet a party of gnomes hunting for
gold."</p>

<p>"I like the animal cakes best," said Bertha.
"The deer are such graceful creatures, and I
like to bite off the horns and legs, one at a
time."</p>

<p>"A long time ago," said their father, "they
used to celebrate Christmas a little different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
from the way we now do. The presents were
all carried to a man in the village who dressed
himself in a white robe, and a big wig made of
flax. He covered his face with a mask, and
then went from house to house. The grown
people received him with great honours. He
called for the children and gave them the
presents their parents had brought to him.</p>

<p>"But these presents were all given according
to the way the children had behaved
during the year. If they had been good and
tried hard, they had the gifts they deserved.
But if they had been naughty and disobedient,
it was not a happy time for them."</p>

<p>"I don't believe the children were very fond
of him," cried Hans. "They must have been
too much afraid of him."</p>

<p>"That is true," said his father. "But now,
let us play some games. Christmas comes but
once a year, and you have all been good
children."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The room soon rang with the shouts of
Hans and his sisters. They played "Blind
Man's Buff" and other games. Their father
took part in all of them as though he were a
boy again. The good mother looked on with
pleasant smiles.</p>

<p>Bedtime came only too soon. But just before
the children said good night, the father took
Hans one side and talked seriously yet lovingly
with him. He told the boy of the faults he
must still fight against. He spoke also of the
improvement he had made during the year.</p>

<p>At the same time the mother gave words of
kind advice to her little daughters. She told
them to keep up good courage; to be busy
and patient in the year to come.</p>

<p>"My dear little girls," she whispered, as
she kissed them, "I love to see you happy
in your play. But the good Lord who cares
for us has given us all some work to do in
this world. Be faithful in doing yours."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>TOY-MAKING</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Wake</span> up, Bertha. Come, Gretchen. You
will have to hurry, for it is quite late," called
their mother. It was one morning about a
week after Christmas.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="man and woman" />
<div class="caption">BERTHA'S FATHER AND MOTHER.</div>
</div>

<p>"Oh dear, I am so sleepy, and my bed is
nice and warm," thought Bertha.</p>

<p>But she jumped up and rubbed her eyes
and began to dress, without waiting to be
called a second time. Her mother was kind
and loving, but she had taught her children
to obey without a question.</p>

<p>Both little girls had long, thick hair. It
must be combed and brushed and braided
with great care. Each one helped the other.
They were soon dressed, and ran down-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the breakfast was over and the
room made tidy, every one in the family sat
down to work. Bertha's father was a toy-maker.
He had made wooden images of
Santa Claus all his life. His wife and children
helped him.</p>

<p>When Bertha was only five years old, she
began to carve the legs of these Santa Claus
dolls. It was a queer sight to see the little
girl's chubby fingers at their work. Now that
she was nine years old, she still carved legs for
Santa Claus in her spare moments.</p>

<p>Gretchen always made arms, while Hans
worked on a still different part of the bodies.
The father and mother carved the heads and
finished the little images that afterward gave
such delight to children in other lands.</p>

<p>Bertha lives in the Black Forest. That
name makes you think at once of a dark and
gloomy place. The woods on the hills are
dark, to be sure, but the valleys nestling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
between are bright and cheerful when the sun
shines down and pours its light upon them.</p>

<p>Bertha's village is in just such a valley. The
church stands on the slope above the little
homes. It seems to say, "Look upward, my
children, to the blue heavens, and do not fear,
even when the mists fill the valley and the
storm is raging over your heads."</p>

<p>All the people in the village seem happy
and contented. They work hard, and their
pay is small, but there are no beggars among
them.</p>

<p>Toys are made in almost every house.
Every one in a family works on the same kind
of toy, just as it is in Bertha's home.</p>

<p>The people think: "It would be foolish to
spend one's time in learning new things. The
longer a person works at making one kind of
toy, the faster he can make them, and he can
earn more money."</p>

<p>One of Bertha's neighbours makes nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
but Noah's Arks. Another makes toy tables,
and still another dolls' chairs.</p>

<p>Bertha often visits a little friend who helps
her father make cuckoo-clocks. Did you ever
see one of these curious clocks? As each
hour comes around, a little bird comes outside
the case. Then it flaps its wings and sings
"cuckoo" in a soft, sweet voice as many times
as there are strokes to the hour. It is great
fun to watch for the little bird and hear its
soft notes.</p>

<p>Perhaps you wonder what makes the bird
come out at just the right time. It is done by
certain machinery inside the clock. But, however
it is, old people as well as children seem
to enjoy the cuckoo-clocks of Germany.</p>

<p>"Some day, when you are older, you shall
go to the fair at Easter time," Bertha's father
has promised her.</p>

<p>"Is that at Leipsic, where our Santa Claus
images go?" asked his little daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, and toys from many other
parts of our country. There you will see
music-boxes and dolls' pianos and carts and
trumpets and engines and ships. These all
come from the mining-towns.</p>

<p>"But I know what my little Bertha would
care for most. She would best like to see
the beautiful wax dolls that come from Sonneberg."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," cried Bertha. "The dear,
lovely dollies with yellow hair like mine. I
would love every one of them. I wish
I could go to Sonneberg just to see the
dolls."</p>

<p>"I wonder what makes the wax stick on,"
said Gretchen, who came into the room while
her father and Bertha were talking.</p>

<p>"After the heads have been moulded into
shape, they are dipped into pans of boiling
wax," her father told her. "The cheap
dolls are dipped only once, but the expensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
ones have several baths before they are
finished. The more wax that is put on, the
handsomer the dolls are.</p>

<p>"Then comes the painting. One girl does
nothing but paint the lips. Another one does
the cheeks. Still another, the eyebrows. Even
then Miss Dolly looks like a bald-headed
baby till her wig is fastened in its place."</p>

<p>"I like the yellow hair best," said Bertha.
"But it isn't real, is it, papa?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean to ask, 'Did it
ever grow on people's heads?' my dear. No.
It is the wool of a kind of goat. But the
black hair is real hair. Most dolls, however,
wear light wigs. People usually prefer
them."</p>

<p>"Do little girls in Sonneberg help make the
dolls, just as Bertha and I help you on the
Santa Claus images?" asked Gretchen.</p>

<p>"Certainly. They fill the bodies with sawdust,
and do other easy things. But they go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to school, too, just as you and Bertha do.
Lessons must not be slighted."</p>

<p>"If I had to help make dolls, just as I do
these images," said Gretchen to her sister as
their father went out and left the children
together, "I don't believe I'd care for the
handsomest one in the whole toy fair. I'd be
sick of the very sight of them."</p>

<p>"Look at the time, Bertha. See, we must
stop our work and start for school," exclaimed
Gretchen.</p>

<p>It was only seven o'clock in the morning,
but school would begin in half an hour.
These little German girls had to study longer
and harder than their American cousins.
They spent at least an hour a day more in
their schoolrooms.</p>

<p>As they trudged along the road, they passed
a little stream which came trickling down the
hillside.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is any story about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
brook," said Bertha. "There's a story about
almost everything in our dear old country, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>"You have heard father tell about the
stream flowing down the side of the Kandel,
haven't you?" asked Gretchen.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. But I don't remember
it very well. What is the story, Gretchen?"</p>

<p>"You know the Kandel is one of the highest
peaks in the Black Forest. You've seen
it, Bertha."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, but tell the story,
Gretchen."</p>

<p>"Well, then, once upon a time there was
a poor little boy who had no father or
mother. He had to tend cattle on the side
of the Kandel. At that time there was a
deep lake at the summit of the mountain.
But the lake had no outlet.</p>

<p>"The people who lived in the valley below
often said, 'Dear me! how glad we should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
if we could only have plenty of fresh water.
But no stream flows near us. If we could only
bring some of the water down from the lake!'</p>

<p>"They were afraid, however, to make a
channel out of the lake. The water might
rush down with such force as to destroy their
village. They feared to disturb it.</p>

<p>"Now, it came to pass that the Evil One
had it in his heart to destroy these people.
He thought he could do it very easily if the
rocky wall on the side of the lake could be
broken down. There was only one way in
which this could be done. An innocent boy
must be found and got to do it.</p>

<p>"It was a long time before such an one
could be found. But at last the Evil One
came across an orphan boy who tended cattle
on the mountainside. The poor little fellow
was on his way home. He was feeling very
sad, for he was thinking of his ragged clothes
and his scant food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Ah ha!' cried the Evil One to himself,
'here is the very boy.'</p>

<p>"He changed himself at once so he had the
form and dress of a hunter, and stepped up to
the lad with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"'Poor little fellow! What is the matter?
And what can I do for you?' he said, in his
most winning manner.</p>

<p>"The boy thought he had found a friend,
and told his story.</p>

<p>"'Do not grieve any longer. There is
plenty of gold and silver in these very mountains.
I will show you how to become rich,'
said the Evil One. 'Meet me here early
to-morrow morning and bring a good strong
team with you. I will help you get the gold.'</p>

<p>"The boy went home with a glad heart.
You may be sure he did not oversleep the
next morning. Before it was light, he had
harnessed four oxen belonging to his master,
and started for the summit of the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"The hunter, who was waiting for him, had
already fastened a metal ring around the wall
that held in the waters of the lake.</p>

<p>"'Fasten the oxen to that ring,' commanded
the hunter, 'and the rock will split open.'</p>

<p>"Somehow or other, the boy did not feel
pleased at what he was told to do. Yet he
obeyed, and started the oxen. But as he did
so, he cried, 'Do this in the name of
God!'</p>

<p>"At that very instant the sky grew black as
night, the thunder rolled and the lightning
flashed. And not only this, for at the same
time the mountain shook and rumbled as
though a mighty force were tearing it apart."</p>

<p>"What became of the poor boy?" asked
Bertha.</p>

<p>"He fell senseless to the ground, while the
oxen in their fright rushed headlong down the
mountainside. But you needn't get excited,
Bertha, no harm was done. The boy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
saved as well as the village, because he had
pulled in the name of God.</p>

<p>"The rock did not split entirely. It broke
apart just enough to let out a tiny stream of
water, which began to flow down the mountainside.</p>

<p>"When the boy came to his senses, the sky
was clear and beautiful once more. The sun
was shining brightly, and the hunter was nowhere
to be seen. But the stream of water
was running down the mountainside.</p>

<p>"A few minutes afterward, the boy's master
came hurrying up the slope. He was frightened
by the dreadful sounds he had heard. But when
he saw the waterfall, he was filled with delight.</p>

<p>"'Every one in the village will rejoice,' he
exclaimed, 'for now we shall never want for
water.'</p>

<p>"Then the little boy took courage and told
the story of his meeting the hunter and what
he had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It is well you did it in the name of the
Lord,' cried his master. 'If you had not, our
village would have been destroyed, and every
one of us would have been drowned.'"</p>

<p>"See! the children are going into the
schoolhouse, Gretchen. We must not be
late. Let's run," said Bertha.</p>

<p>The two little girls stopped talking, and
hurried so fast that they entered the schoolhouse
and were sitting in their seats in good
order before the schoolmaster struck his bell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>THE WICKED BISHOP</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> Rhine is the loveliest river in the
world. I know it must be," said Bertha.</p>

<p>"Of course it is," answered her brother.
"I've seen it, and I ought to know. And
father thinks so, too. He says it is not only
beautiful, but it is also bound into the whole
history of our country. Think of the battles
that have been fought on its shores, and the
great generals who have crossed it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the castles, Hans! Think of
the legends father and mother have told us
about the beautiful princesses who have lived
in the castles, and the brave knights who have
fought for them! I shall be perfectly happy
if I can ever sail down the Rhine and see the
noted places on its shores."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"The schoolmaster has taught you all about
the war with France, hasn't he, Bertha?"</p>

<p>"Of course. And it really seemed at one
time as if France would make us Germans
agree to have the Rhine divide the two countries.
Just as if we would be willing to let
the French own one shore of our beautiful
river. I should say not!"</p>

<p>Bertha's cheeks grew rosier than usual at
the thought of such a thing. She talked faster
than German children usually do, for they are
rather slow in their speech.</p>

<p>"We do not own all of the river, little
sister, as it is. The baby Rhine sleeps in
an icy cradle in the mountains of Switzerland.
Then it makes its way through our country,
but before it reaches the sea it flows through
the low lands of Holland."</p>

<p>"I know all that, Hans. But we own the
best of the Rhine, anyway. I am perfectly
satisfied."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I knew all the legends about the
river. There are enough of them to fill many
books. Did you ever hear about the Rats'
Tower opposite the town of Bingen, Bertha?"</p>

<p>"What a funny name for a tower! No.
Is there a story about it, Hans?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one of the boys was telling it to
me yesterday while we were getting wood
in the forest. It is a good story, although
my friend said he wasn't sure it is true."</p>

<p>"What is the story?"</p>

<p>"It is about a very wicked bishop who was
a miser. It happened one time that the
harvests were poor and grain was scarce. The
cruel bishop bought all the grain he could
get and locked it up. He intended to sell it
for a high price, and in this way to become
very rich.</p>

<p>"As the days went by, the food became
scarcer and scarcer. The people began to
sicken and die of hunger. They had but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
thought: they must get something to eat for
their children and themselves.</p>

<p>"They knew of the stores of grain held by
the bishop. They went to him and begged
for some of it, but he paid no attention to
their prayers. Then they demanded that he
open the doors of the storehouse and let them
have the grain. It was of no use.</p>

<p>"At last, they gathered together, and
said:</p>

<p>"'We will break down the door if you
do not give it to us.'</p>

<p>"'Come to-morrow,' answered the bishop.
'Bring your friends with you. You shall have
all the grain you desire.'</p>

<p>"The morrow came. Crowds gathered in
front of the granary. The bishop unlocked
the door, saying:</p>

<p>"'Go inside and help yourselves freely.'</p>

<p>"The people rushed in. Then what do
you think the cruel bishop did? He ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his servants to lock the door and set the place
on fire!</p>

<p>"The air was soon filled with the screams
of the burning people. But the bishop only
laughed and danced. He said to his servants:</p>

<p>"'Do you hear the rats squeaking inside the
granary?'</p>

<p>"The next day came. There were only
ashes in place of the great storehouse. There
seemed to be no life about the town, for the
people were all dead.</p>

<p>"Suddenly there was a great scurrying, as a
tremendous swarm of rats came rushing out of
the ashes. On they came, more and more
of them. They filled the streets, and even
made their way into the palace.</p>

<p>"The wicked bishop was filled with fear.
He fled from the place and hurried away
over the fields. But the swarm of rats came
rushing after him. He came to Bingen, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he hoped to be safe within its walls. Somehow
or other, the rats made their way inside.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="Tower next to a fiver" />
<div class="caption">THE RATS' TOWER.</div>
</div>

<p>"There was now only one hope of safety.
The bishop fled to a tower standing in the
middle of the Rhine. But it was of no use!
The rats swam the river and made their way
up the sides of the tower. Their sharp teeth
gnawed holes through the doors and windows.
They entered in and came to the room where
the bishop was hiding."</p>

<p>"Wicked fellow! They killed and ate
him as he deserved, didn't they?" asked
Bertha.</p>

<p>"There wasn't much left of him in a few
minutes. But the tower still stands, and you
can see it if you ever go to Bingen, although
it is a crumbling old pile now."</p>

<p>"Rats' Tower is a good name for it. But
I would rather hear about enchanted princesses
and brave knights than wicked old bishops.
Tell me another story, Hans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I can't. Listen! I hear some one
coming. Who can it be?"</p>

<p>Hans jumped up and ran to the door, just
in time to meet his Uncle Fritz, who lived in
Strasburg.</p>

<p>The children loved him dearly. He was a
young man about twenty-one years old. He
came home to this little village in the Black
Forest only about once a year. He had so
much to tell and was so kind and cheerful,
every one was glad to see him.</p>

<p>"Uncle Fritz! Uncle Fritz! We are so
glad you've come," exclaimed Bertha, putting
her arms around his neck. "And we are
going to have something that you like for
dinner."</p>

<p>"I can guess what it is. Sauerkraut and
boiled pork. There is no other sauerkraut in
Germany as good as that your mother makes,
I do believe. I'm hungry enough to eat the
whole dishful and not leave any for you children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Now what do you say to my coming?
Don't you wish I had stayed in Strasburg?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Uncle Fritz. We would
rather see you than anybody else," cried Hans.
"And here comes mother. She will be just
as glad as we are."</p>

<p>That evening, after Hans had shown his
uncle around the village, and he had called on
his old friends, he settled himself in the chimney-corner
with the children about him.</p>

<p>"Talk to us about Strasburg, Uncle Fritz,"
begged Gretchen.</p>

<p>"Please tell us about the storks," said Bertha.
"Are there great numbers of the birds
in the city, and do they build their nests on
the chimneys?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can see plenty of storks flying
overhead if you will come back with me," said
Uncle Fritz, laughingly. "They seem to
know the people love them. If a stork makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
his home about any one's house, it is a sign of
good fortune to the people who live there.</p>

<p>"'It will surely come,' they say to themselves,
'and the storks will bring it.' Do you
wonder the people like the birds so much?"</p>

<p>"I read a story about a mother stork," said
Bertha, thoughtfully. "She had a family of
baby birds. They were not big enough to
leave their nest, when a fire broke out in the
chimney where it was built. Poor mother bird!
She could have saved herself. But she would
not leave her babies. So she stayed with them
and they were all burned to death together."</p>

<p>"I know the story. That happened right
in Strasburg," said her uncle.</p>

<p>"Please tell us about the beautiful cathedral
with its tall tower," said Hans. "Sometime,
uncle, I am going to Strasburg, if I have to
walk there, and then I shall want to spend a
whole day in front of the wonderful clock."</p>

<p>"You'd better have a lunch with you, Hans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and then you will not get hungry. But really,
my dear little nephew, I hope the time will
soon come when you can pay me a long visit.
As for the clock, you will have to stay in front
of it all night as well as all day, if you are to
see all it can show you."</p>

<p>"I know about cuckoo-clocks, of course,"
said Gretchen, "but the little bird is the only
figure that comes out on those. There are
ever so many different figures on the Strasburg
clock, aren't there, Uncle Fritz?"</p>

<p>"A great, great many. Angels strike the
hours. A different god or goddess appears for
each day in the week. Then, at noon and
at midnight, Jesus and his twelve apostles
come out through a door and march about on
a platform.</p>

<p>"You can imagine what the size of the
clock must be when I tell you that the figures
are as large as people. When the procession
of the apostles appears, a gilded cock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
on the top of the tower flaps its wings and
crows.</p>

<p>"I cannot begin to tell you all about it. It
is as good as a play, and, as I told Hans,
he would have to stay many hours near it
to see all the sights."</p>

<p>"I should think a strong man would
be needed to wind it up," said his
nephew.</p>

<p>"The best part of it is that it does not need
to be wound every day," replied Uncle Fritz.
"They say it will run for years without being
touched. Of course, travellers are coming
to Strasburg all the time. They wish to see
the clock, but they also come to see the
cathedral itself. It is a very grand building,
and, as you know, the spire is the tallest one
in all Europe.</p>

<p>"Then there is so much beautiful carving!
And there are such fine statues. Oh, children,
you must certainly come to Strasburg before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
long and see the cathedral of which all Germany
is so proud."</p>

<p>"Strasburg was for a time the home of our
greatest poet," said Bertha. "I want to go
there to see where he lived."</p>

<p>The child was very fond of poetry, even
though she was a little country girl. Her
father had a book containing some of Goethe's
ballads, and she loved to lie under the trees
in the pleasant summer-time and repeat some
of these poems.</p>

<p>"They are just like music," she would say
to herself.</p>

<p>"A marble slab has been set up in the old
Fish Market to mark the spot where Goethe
lived," said Uncle Fritz. "They say he loved
the grand cathedral of the city, and it helped
him to become a great writer when he was
a young student there. I suppose its beauty
awakened his own beautiful thoughts."</p>

<p>The children became quiet as they thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of their country and the men who had made
her so strong and great,&mdash;the poets, and
the musicians, and the brave soldiers who
had defended her from her enemies.</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz was the first one to speak.</p>

<p>"I will tell you a story of Strasburg," he
said. "It is about something that happened
there a long time ago. You know, the city
isn't on the Rhine itself, but it is on a little
stream flowing into the greater river.</p>

<p>"Well, once upon a time the people of
Zurich, in Switzerland, asked the people
of Strasburg to join with them in a bond
of friendship. Each should help the other
in times of danger. The people of Strasburg
did not think much of the idea. They said
among themselves: 'What good can the little
town of Zurich do us? And, besides, it is too
far away.' So they sent back word that they
did not care to make such a bond. They
were scarcely polite in their message, either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"When they heard the reply, the men
of Zurich were quite angry. They were
almost ready to fight. But the youngest one
of their councillors said:</p>

<p>"'We will force them to eat their own
words. Indeed, they shall be made to give us
a different answer. And it will come soon,
too, if you will only leave the matter with me.'</p>

<p>"'Do as you please,' said the other councillors.
They went back to their own houses,
while the young man hurried home, rushed
out into the kitchen and picked out the
largest kettle there.</p>

<p>"'Wife, cook as much oatmeal as this
pot will hold,' he commanded.</p>

<p>"The woman wondered what in the world
her husband could be thinking of. But she
lost no time in guessing. She ordered her
servants to make a big fire, while she herself
stirred and cooked the great kettleful
of oatmeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the meanwhile, her husband hurried
down to the pier, and got his swiftest boat
ready for a trip down the river. Then he
gathered the best rowers in the town.</p>

<p>"'Come with me,' he said to two of
them, when everything had been made ready
for a trip. They hastened home with him,
as he commanded.</p>

<p>"'Is the oatmeal ready?' he cried, rushing
breathless into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"His wife had just finished her work. The
men lifted the kettle from the fire and ran with
it to the waiting boat. It was placed in the
stern and the oarsmen sprang to their places.</p>

<p>"'Pull, men! Pull with all the strength you
have, and we will go to Strasburg in time to
show those stupid people that, if it should be
necessary, we live near enough to them to give
them a hot supper.'</p>

<p>"How the men worked! They rowed as
they had never rowed before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"They passed one village after another.
Still they moved onward without stopping, till
they found themselves at the pier of Strasburg.</p>

<p>"The councillor jumped out of the boat,
telling two of his men to follow with the great
pot of oatmeal. He led the way to the council-house,
where he burst in with his strange
present.</p>

<p>"'I bring you a warm answer to your cold
words,' he told the surprised councillors. He
spoke truly, for the pot was still steaming.
How amused they all were!</p>

<p>"'What a clever fellow he is,' they said
among themselves. 'Surely we will agree to
make the bond with Zurich, if it holds many
men like him.'</p>

<p>"The bond was quickly signed and then,
with laughter and good-will, the councillors
gathered around the kettle with spoons and
ate every bit of the oatmeal.</p>

<p>"'It is excellent,' they all cried. And indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it was still hot enough to burn the mouths of
those who were not careful."</p>

<p>"Good! Good!" cried the children, and
they laughed heartily, even though it was a
joke against their own people.</p>

<p>Their father and mother had also listened to
the story and enjoyed it as much as the children.</p>

<p>"Another story, please, dear Uncle Fritz,"
they begged.</p>

<p>But their father pointed to the clock. "Too
late, too late, my dears," he said. "If you sit
up any longer, your mother will have to call
you more than once in the morning. So, away
to your beds, every one of you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>THE COFFEE-PARTY</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> would you like to be a wood-cutter,
Hans?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be great sport. I like to
hear the thud of the axe as it comes down on
the trunk. Then it is always an exciting time
as the tree begins to bend and fall to the
ground. Somehow, it seems like a person.
I can't help pitying it, either."</p>

<p>Hans had come over to the next village on
an errand for his father. A big sawmill had
been built on the side of the stream, and all
the men in the place were kept busy cutting
down trees in the Black Forest, or working in
the sawmill.</p>

<p>After the logs had been cut the right length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
they were bound into rafts, and floated down
the little stream to the Rhine.</p>

<p>"The rafts themselves seem alive," said
Hans to his friend. "You men know just
how to bind the logs together with those willow
bands, so they twist and turn about like living
creatures as they move down the stream."</p>

<p>"I have travelled on a raft all the way from
here to Cologne," answered the wood-cutter.
"The one who steers must be skilful, for he
needs to be very careful. You know the rafts
grow larger all the time, don't you, Hans?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. As the river becomes wider, the
smaller ones are bound together. But is it
true that the men sometimes take their families
along with them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. They set up tents, or little
huts, on the rafts, so their wives and children
can have a comfortable place to eat and sleep.
Then, too, if it rains, they can be sheltered
from the storm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to go with you sometime. You
pass close to Strasburg, and I could stop and
visit Uncle Fritz. Wouldn't it be fun!"</p>

<p>"Hans! Hans!" called a girl's voice just
then.</p>

<p>"I don't see her, but I know that's Bertha.
She came over to the village with me this afternoon.
One of her friends has a coffee-party
and she invited us to it. So, good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my lad. Come and see me
again. Perhaps I can manage sometime to
take you with me on a trip down the river."</p>

<p>"Thank you ever so much."</p>

<p>Hans hurried away, and was soon entering
the house of a little friend who was celebrating
her birthday with a coffee-party.</p>

<p>There were several other children there.
They were all dressed in their best clothes and
looked very neat and nice. The boys wore
long trousers and straight jackets. They
looked like little old men. The girls had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
bright-coloured skirts and their white waists
were fresh and stiff.</p>

<p>Their shoes were coarse and heavy, and
made a good deal of noise as the children
played the different games. But they were
all so plump and rosy, it was good to look
at them.</p>

<p>"They are a pretty sight," said one of the
neighbours, as she poured out the coffee.</p>

<p>"They deserve to have a good time," said
another woman with a kind, motherly face.
"They will soon grow up, and then they will
have to work hard to get a living."</p>

<p>The coffee and cakes were a great treat to
these village children. They did not get such
a feast every day in the year. Their mothers
made cakes only for festivals and holidays, and
coffee was seldom seen on their tables oftener
than once a week.</p>

<p>In the great cities and fine castles, where
the rich people of Germany had their homes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
they could eat sweet dainties and drink coffee
as often as they liked. But in the villages of
the Black Forest, it was quite different.</p>

<p>"Good night, good night," said Hans and
Bertha, as they left their friends and trudged
off on a path through the woods. It was the
shortest way home, and they knew their
mother must be looking for them by this
time.</p>

<p>It was just sunset, but the children could
not see the beautiful colours of the evening
sky, after they had gone a short distance into
the thick woods.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose there are any bears
around?" whispered Bertha.</p>

<p>The trees looked very black. It seemed to
the little girl as though she kept seeing the
shadow of some big animal hiding behind
them.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," answered Hans, quite scornfully.
"Too many people go along this path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
for bears to be willing to stay around here.
You would have to go farther up into the
forest to find them. But look quickly,
Bertha. Do you see that rabbit jumping
along? Isn't he a big fellow?"</p>

<p>"See! Hans, he has noticed us. There he
goes as fast as his legs can carry him."</p>

<p>By this time, the children had reached the
top of a hill. The trees grew very thick and
close. On one side a torrent came rushing
down over the rocks and stones. It seemed
to say:</p>

<p>"I cannot stop for any one. But come
with me, come with me, and I will take you
to the beautiful Rhine. I will show you the
way to pretty bridges, and great stone castles,
and rare old cities. Oh, this is a wonderful
world, and you children of the Black Forest
have a great deal to see yet."</p>

<p>"I love to listen to running water," said
Bertha. "It always has a story to tell us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you see that light over there, away off
in the distance?" asked Hans. "It comes
from a charcoal-pit. I can hear the voices of
the men at their work."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to stay out in the dark
woods all the time and make charcoal,"
answered his sister. "I should get lonesome
and long for the sunlight."</p>

<p>"It isn't very easy work, either," said
Hans. "After the trees have  been cut
down, the pits have to be made with the
greatest care, and the wood must be burned
just so slowly to change it into charcoal. I
once spent a day in the forest with some
charcoal-burners. They told such good
stories that night came before I had thought
of it."</p>

<p>"I can see the village ahead of us," said
Bertha, joyfully.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterward, the children were
running up the stone steps of their own home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"We had such a good time," Hans told
his mother, while Bertha went to Gretchen
and gave her some cakes she had brought
her from the coffee-party.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry you couldn't go," she told
her sister.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can next time," answered
Gretchen. "But, of course, we could not all
leave mother when she had so much work
to do. So I just kept busy and tried to
forget all about it."</p>

<p>"You dear, good Gretchen! I'm going to
try to be as patient and helpful as you
are," said Bertha, kissing her sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>THE BEAUTIFUL CASTLE</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Father's</span> coming, father's coming," cried
Bertha, as she ran down the steps and out
into the street.</p>

<p>Her father had been away for two days, and
Hans had gone with him. They had been to
Heidelberg. Bertha and Gretchen had never
yet visited that city, although it was not more
than twenty miles away.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I don't know where to begin,"
Hans told the girls that evening.</p>

<p>"Of course, I liked to watch the students
better than anything else. The town seems
full of them. They all study in the university,
of course, but they are on the streets
a good deal. They seem to have a fine time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of it. Every one carries a small cane with
a button on the end of it. They wear their
little caps down over their foreheads on one
side."</p>

<p>"What colour do they have for their caps,
Hans?" asked Gretchen.</p>

<p>"All colours, I believe. Some are red, some
blue, some yellow, some green. Oh, I can't
tell you how many different kinds there are.
But they were bright and pretty, and made the
streets look as though it must be a festival
day."</p>

<p>"I have heard that the students fight a
good many duels. Is that so, Hans?"</p>

<p>"If you should see them, you would certainly
think so. Many of the fellows are real
handsome, but their faces are scarred more
often than not.</p>

<p>"'The more scars I can show, the braver
people will think I am.' That is what the
students seem to think. They get up duels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with each other on the smallest excuse. When
they fight, they always try to strike the face.
Father says their duelling is good practice. It
really helps to make them brave. If I were a
student, I should want to fight duels, too."</p>

<p>Bertha shuddered. Duelling was quite the
fashion in German universities, but the little
girl was very tender-hearted. She could not
bear to think of her brother having his face
cut up by the sword of any one in the world.</p>

<p>"What do you think, girls?" Hans went
on. "Father had to go to the part of the town
nearest the castle. He said he should be busy
for several hours, and I could do what I liked.
So I climbed up the hill to the castle, and
wandered all around it. I saw a number of
English and American people there. I suppose
they had come to Heidelberg on purpose
to see those buildings.</p>

<p>"'Isn't it beautiful!' I heard them exclaim
again and again. And I saw a boy about my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
own age writing things about it in a note-book.
He told his mother he was going to say
it was the most beautiful ruin in Germany.
He was an American boy, but he spoke our
language. I suppose he was just learning
it, for he made ever so many mistakes. I
could hardly tell what he was trying to say."</p>

<p>"What did his mother answer?" asked
Bertha.</p>

<p>"She nodded her head, and then pointed
out some of the finest carvings and statues.
But she and her son moved away from me
before long, and then I found myself near
some children of our country. They must
have been rich, for they were dressed quite
grandly. Their governess was with them.
She told them to notice how many different
kinds of buildings there were, some of them
richly carved, and some quite plain. 'You
will find here palaces, towers, and fortresses,
all together,' she said. 'For, in the old days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it was not only a grand home, but it was also
a strong fortress.'"</p>

<div class="caption">COURTYARD OF HEIDELBERG CASTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>"You know father told us it was not built
all at once," said Gretchen. "Different parts
were added during four hundred years."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he said it had been stormed by
the enemy, and burned and plundered," added
Bertha. "It has been in the hands of those
horrid Frenchmen several different times.
Did you see the blown-up tower, Hans?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. Half of it, you know,
fell into the moat during one of the sieges, but
linden-trees have grown about it, and it makes
a shady nook in which to rest one's self."</p>

<p>"You did not go inside of the castle, did
you, Hans?" asked Gretchen.</p>

<p>"No. It looked so big and gloomy,
I stayed outside in the pretty gardens. I
climbed over some of the moss-grown stairs,
though, and I kept discovering something I
hadn't seen before. Here and there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
old fountains and marble statues, all gray
with age."</p>

<p>"They say that under the castle are great,
dark dungeons," said Bertha, shivering at the
thought.</p>

<p>"What would a castle be without dungeons?"
replied her brother. "Of course
there are dungeons. And there are also
hidden, underground passages through which
the people inside could escape in times of
war and siege."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hans! did you see the Heidelberg
Tun?" asked Gretchen.</p>

<p>Now, the Heidelberg Tun is the largest
wine-cask in the whole world. People say
that it holds forty-nine thousand gallons.
Just think of it! But it has not been filled
for more than a hundred years.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see it," replied Hans. "It
is down in the cellar, and I didn't want to go
there without father. I heard some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
visitors telling about the marks of the Frenchmen's
hatchets on its sides. One of the times
they captured the castle, they tried to break
open the tun. They thought it was full of
wine. But they did not succeed in hacking
through its tough sides."</p>

<p>"Good! Good!" cried his sisters. They
had little love for France and her people.</p>

<p>That evening, after Hans had finished telling
the girls about his visit, their father told
them the legend of Count Frederick, a brave
and daring man who once lived in Heidelberg
Castle.</p>

<p>Count Frederick was so brave and successful
that he was called "Frederick the
Victorious."</p>

<p>Once upon a time he was attacked by the
knights and bishops of the Rhine, who had
banded together against him. When he found
what great numbers of soldiers were attacking
his castle, Count Frederick was not frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the least. He armed his men with sharp
daggers, and marched boldly out against his
foes.</p>

<p>They attacked the horses first of all. The
daggers made short work, and the knights
were soon brought to the ground. Their
armour was so heavy that it was an easy
matter then to make them prisoners and take
them into the castle.</p>

<p>But Frederick treated them most kindly.
He ordered a great banquet to be prepared,
and invited his prisoners to gather around the
board, where all sorts of good things were
served.</p>

<p>One thing only was lacking. There was no
bread. The guests thought it was because the
servants had forgotten it, and one of them
dared to ask for a piece. Count Frederick
at once turned toward his steward and
ordered the bread to be brought. Now his
master had privately talked with the steward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and had told him what words to use at this
time.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said the steward, "but
there is no bread."</p>

<p>"You must bake some at once," ordered
his master.</p>

<p>"But we have no flour," was the answer.</p>

<p>"You must grind some, then," was the
command.</p>

<p>"We cannot do so, for we have no grain."</p>

<p>"Then see that some is threshed immediately."</p>

<p>"That is impossible, for the harvests have
been burned down," replied the steward.</p>

<p>"You can at least sow grain, that we may
have new harvests as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"We cannot even do that, for our enemies
have burned down all the buildings where
the grain was stored for seed-time."</p>

<p>Frederick now turned to his visitors, and
told them they must eat their meat without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
bread. But that was not all. He told them
they must give him enough money to build
new houses and barns to take the places of
those they had destroyed, and also to buy new
seed for grain.</p>

<p>"It is wrong," he said, sternly, "to carry
on war against those who are helpless, and
to take away their seeds and tools from the
poor peasants."</p>

<p>It was a sensible speech. It made the
knights ashamed of the way they had been
carrying on war in the country, and they left
the castle wiser and better men.</p>

<p>All this happened long, long ago, before
Germany could be called one country, for
the different parts of the land were ruled
over by different people and in different
ways.</p>

<p>This same Count Frederick, their father
told them, had great love for the poor.
When he was still quite young, he made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
vow. He said, "I will never marry a woman
of noble family."</p>

<p>Not long after this, he fell in love with
a princess. But he could not ask her to
marry him on account of the vow he had
made.</p>

<p>He was so unhappy that he went into the
army. He did not wish to live, and hoped he
would soon meet death.</p>

<p>But the fair princess loved Frederick as
deeply as he loved her, and as soon as she
learned of the vow he had made, she made
up her mind what to do.</p>

<p>She put on the dress of a poor singing-girl,
and left her grand home. She followed
Frederick from place to place. They
met face to face one beautiful evening.
Then it was that the princess told her lover
she had given up her rank and title for his
sake.</p>

<p>How joyful she made him as he listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to her story! You may be sure they were
soon married, and the young couple went to
live in Heidelberg Castle, where they were as
happy and as merry as the day is long.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>THE GREAT FREDERICK</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I declare</span>, Hans, I should think you
would get tired of playing war," said Bertha.
She was sitting under the trees rocking her
doll. She was playing it was a baby.</p>

<p>Hans had just come home after an afternoon
of sport with his boy friends. But all
they had done, Bertha declared, was to play
war and soldiers. She had watched them
from her own yard.</p>

<p>"Tired of it! What a silly idea, Bertha.
It won't be many years before I shall be
a real soldier. Just picture me then! I shall
have a uniform, and march to music. I don't
know where I may go, either. Who knows
to what part of the world the emperor will
send his soldiers at that time?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know where you would like to go in our
own country," said Bertha.</p>

<p>"To Berlin, of course. What a grand city
it must be! Father has been there. Our
schoolmaster was there while he served his
time as a soldier. At this very moment, it
almost seems as though I could hear the
jingling of the officers' swords as they move
along the streets. The regiments are drilled
every day, and I don't know how often the
soldiers have sham battles."</p>

<p>Hans jumped up from his seat under the
tree and began to march up and down as
though he were a soldier already.</p>

<p>"Attention, battalion! Forward, march!"
Bertha called after him. But she was laughing
as she spoke. She could not help it,
Hans looked so serious. At the same time
she couldn't help envying her brother a little,
and wishing she were a boy, too. It must
be so grand to be a soldier and be ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
fight for the emperor who ruled over her
country.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i087.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="crowd around statue of manon horse" />
<div class="caption">STATUE OF FREDERICK THE GREAT.</div>
</div>

<p>"The schoolmaster told us boys yesterday
about the grand palace at Berlin. The emperor
lives in it when he is in the city," said
Hans, wheeling around suddenly and stopping
in front of Bertha.</p>

<p>"I think you must have caught my
thoughts," said the little girl, "for the emperor
was in my mind when you began to
speak."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind that. Do you wish
to hear about the palace?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, Hans."</p>

<p>"The schoolmaster says it has six hundred
rooms. Just think of it! And one of them,
called the White Room, is furnished so
grandly that 2,400,000 marks were spent on
it. You can't imagine it, Bertha, of course.
I can't, either."</p>

<p>A German mark is worth about twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cents of American money, so the furnishing
of the room Hans spoke of must have cost
about $600,000. It was a large sum, and
it is no wonder the boy said he could
hardly imagine so much money.</p>

<p>"There are hundreds of halls in the
palace," Hans went on. "Some of their
walls are painted and others are hung with
elegant silk draperies. The floors are polished
so they shine like mirrors. Then the
pictures and the armour, Bertha! It almost
seemed as though I were there while the
schoolmaster was describing them."</p>

<p>"I never expect to see such lovely things,"
said his sober little sister. "But perhaps I
shall go to Berlin some day, Hans. Then
I can see the statue of Frederick the Great,
at any rate."</p>

<p>"It stands opposite the palace," said her
brother, "and cost more than any other
bronze statue in the world."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you learn that, Hans?"</p>

<p>"The schoolmaster told us so. He said,
too, that it ought to stir the blood of every
true German to look at it. There the great
Frederick sits on horseback, wearing the robe
in which he was crowned, and looking out
from under his cocked hat with his bright,
sharp eyes. That statue alone is enough
to make the soldiers who march past it ready
to give their lives for their country."</p>

<p>"He lived when the different kingdoms
were separated from each other, and there
was no one ruler over all of them. I know
that," said Bertha.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was the King of Prussia. And
he fought the Seven Years' War with France
and came out victorious. Hardly any one
thought he could succeed, for there was so
much against him. But he was brave and
determined. Those two things were worth
everything else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"That wasn't the only war he won, either,
Hans."</p>

<p>"No, but it must have been the greatest.
Did you know, Bertha, that he was unhappy
when he was young? His father was so strict
that he tried to run away from Germany with
two of his friends. The king found out
what they meant to do. One of the friends
was put to death, and the other managed
to escape."</p>

<p>"What did his father do to Frederick?"
Bertha's eyes were full of pity for a prince
who was so unhappy as to wish to run away.</p>

<p>"The king ordered his son to be put to
death. But I suppose he was angry at the
time, for he changed his mind before the
sentence was carried out, and forgave him."</p>

<p>"I wonder how kings and emperors live,"
said Bertha, slowly. It seemed as though
everything must be different with them from
what it was with other people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you about Frederick, if you wish
to listen."</p>

<p>"Of course I do, Hans."</p>

<p>"In the first place, he didn't care anything
about fine clothes, even if he was a king and
was born in the grand palace at Berlin. His
coat was often very shabby.</p>

<p>"In the next place, he slept only about four
hours out of the whole twenty-four for a good
many years. He got up at three o'clock on
summer mornings, and in the winter-time he
was always dressed by five, at the very latest.</p>

<p>"While his hair-dresser was at work, he
opened his most important letters. After that,
he attended to other business affairs of the
country. These things were done before eating
or drinking. But when they had been
attended to, the king went into his writing-room
and drank a number of glasses of cold
water. As he wrote, he sipped coffee and ate
a little fruit from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"He loved music very dearly, and sometimes
rested from his work and played on his
flute.</p>

<p>"Dinner was the only regular meal of the
day. It was served at twelve o'clock, and
lasted three or four hours. There was a bill
of fare, and the names of the cooks were given
as well as the dishes they prepared."</p>

<p>"Did the king ever let them know whether
he was pleased or not with their cooking?"
asked Bertha.</p>

<p>"Yes. He marked the dishes he liked best
with a cross. He enjoyed his dinner, and
generally had a number of friends to eat with
him. There was much joking, and there were
many clever speeches.</p>

<p>"When the meal was over, the king played
on his flute a short time, and then attended to
more business."</p>

<p>"Did he work till bedtime, Hans?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. In the evening there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
concert or lecture, or something like that.
But, all the same, the king was a hardworking
man, even in times of peace."</p>

<p>"He loved his people dearly, father once
told me," said Bertha. "He said he understood
his subjects and they understood him."</p>

<p>"Yes, and that reminds me of a story the
schoolmaster told. King Frederick was once
riding through the street when he saw a crowd
of people gathered together. He said to his
groom, 'Go and see what is the matter.'
The man came back and told the king that
the people were all looking at a caricature
of Frederick himself. A caricature, you know,
is a comical portrait.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think the king was angry
when he heard this. Not at all. He said,
'Go and hang the picture lower down, so
they will not have to stretch their necks to
see it.'</p>

<p>"The crowd heard the words. 'Hurrah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for the king!' they cried. At the same time,
they began to tear the picture into pieces."</p>

<p>"Frederick the Great could appreciate a
joke," said Bertha. "I should think the
people must have loved him."</p>

<p>"He had some fine buildings put up in his
lifetime," Hans went on. "A new palace was
built in Berlin, besides another one the king
called 'Sans Souci.' Those are French words
meaning, 'Without a Care.' He called the
place by that name because he said he was
free-hearted and untroubled while he stayed
there.</p>

<p>"I've told you these things because you are
a girl. But I'll tell you what I like to think
of best of all. It's the stories of the wars
in which he fought and in which he showed
such wonderful courage. So, hurrah for Frederick
the Great, King of Prussia!"</p>

<p>Hans made a salute as though he stood
in the presence of the great king. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he started for the wood-pile, where he was
soon sawing logs with as much energy as if
he were fighting against the enemies of his
country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>THE BRAVE PRINCESS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Listen</span>, children! That must be the
song of a nightingale. How sweet it is!"</p>

<p>It was a lovely Sunday afternoon. Every
one in the family had been to church in
the morning, and come home to a good
dinner of bean soup and potato salad. Then
the father had said:</p>

<p>"Let us take a long walk over the fields
and through the woods. The world is beautiful
to-day. We can enjoy it best by leaving
the house behind us."</p>

<p>Some of the neighbours joined the merry
party. The men smoked their pipes, while
the women chatted together and the children
frolicked about them and picked wild flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>How many sweet smells there were in the
fields! How gaily the birds sang! The air
seemed full of peace and joy.</p>

<p>They all wandered on till they came to
a cascade flowing down over some high rocks.
Trees grew close to the waterfall, and bent
over it as though to hide it from curious eyes.
It was a pretty spot.</p>

<p>"Let us sit down at the foot of this
cascade," said Bertha's father. "It is a pleasant
place to rest."</p>

<p>Every one liked the plan. Bertha nestled
close to her father's side.</p>

<p>"Tell us a story. Please do," she said.</p>

<p>"Ask neighbour Abel. He knows many a
legend of just such places as this. He has
lived in the Hartz Mountains, and they are
filled with fairy stories."</p>

<p>The rest of the party heard what was said.</p>

<p>"Neighbour Abel! A story, a story," they
cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the kind-hearted German could
not refuse such a general request. Besides, he
liked to tell stories. Taking his long pipe
out of his mouth, he laid it down on the
ground beside him. Then he cleared his
throat and began to speak.</p>

<p>"Look above you, friends. Do you see
that mark on the rocky platform overhead?
I noticed it as soon as I got here. It made
me think of a wild spot in the Hartz Mountains
where there is just such a mark. The
people call it 'The Horse's Hoof-print.' I
will tell you how they explain its coming there.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time there was a beautiful
princess. Her name was Brunhilda, and she
lived in Bohemia. She lived a gay and happy
life, like most young princesses, till one day
a handsome prince arrived at her father's
palace. He was the son of the king of
the Hartz country.</p>

<p>"Of course, you can all guess what happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The prince fell in love with the
princess, and she returned his love. The day
was set for the wedding, and the young prince
went home to prepare for the great event.</p>

<p>"But he had been gone only a short time
when a powerful giant arrived at Brunhilda's
home. He came from the far north. His
name was Bodo.</p>

<p>"He asked for the princess in marriage, but
her heart had already been given away. She
did not care for the giant, even though he
gave her the most elegant presents,&mdash;a beautiful
white horse, jewels set in gold, and chains
of amber.</p>

<p>"'I dare not refuse the giant,' said Brunhilda's
father. 'He is very powerful, and we
must not make him angry. You must marry
him, my daughter, in three days.'</p>

<p>"The poor maiden wept bitterly. It seemed
as though her heart would break. But she
was a clever girl, and she soon dried her tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and began to think of some plan by which she
might yet be free. She began to smile upon
the giant and treat him with great kindness.</p>

<p>"'I should like to try the beautiful horse
you brought me,' she said to him. He was
much pleased. The horse was brought to the
door. The princess mounted him and rode
for a time up and down in front of the
palace.</p>

<p>"The very next day was that set apart
for the wedding. The castle was filled with
guests who feasted and made merry. The
giant entered into everything with a will. He
laughed till the floors and walls shook. Little
did he think what was taking place. For the
princess slipped out of the castle when no one
was watching, hurried into the stable, and
leaped upon the back of her swift white horse.</p>

<p>"'Lower the drawbridge instantly,' she
called to the guard. She passed over it,
and away she flew like the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were too late, too late, O giant,
when you discovered that Brunhilda was
missing.</p>

<p>"He flew out of the castle, and on the back
of his own fiery black horse he dashed after
the runaway princess.</p>

<p>"On they went! On, on, without stopping.
Over the plains, up and down the hillsides,
through the villages. The sun set and darkness
fell upon the world, but there was never
a moment's rest for the maiden on the white
horse or the giant lover on his black steed.</p>

<p>"Sometimes in the darkness sparks were
struck off from the horses' hoofs as they
passed over rough and rocky places. These
sparks always showed the princess ahead and
slowly increasing the distance between herself
and her pursuer.</p>

<p>"When the morning light first appeared,
the maiden could see the summit of the
Brocken ahead of her. It was the home of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
her lover. Her heart leaped within her. If
she could only reach it she would be safe.</p>

<p>"But alas! her horse suddenly stood still.
He would not move. He had reached the
edge of a precipice. There it lay, separating
the princess from love and safety.</p>

<p>"The brave girl had not a moment to lose.
The giant was fast drawing near. She wheeled
her horse around; then, striking his sides a
sharp blow with her whip, she urged him to
leap across the precipice.</p>

<p>"The spring must be strong and sure. It
was a matter of life and death. The chasm
was deep. If the horse should fail to strike
the other side securely, it meant a horrible end
to beast and rider.</p>

<p>"But he did not fail. The feet of the
brave steed came firmly down upon the rocky
platform. So heavily did they fall that the
imprint of a hoof was left upon the rock.</p>

<p>"The princess was now safe. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
an easy matter for her to reach her lover's
side.</p>

<p>"As for the giant, he tried to follow Brunhilda
across the chasm. But he was too heavy
and his horse failed to reach the mark. The
two sank together to the bottom of the
precipice."</p>

<p>Every one thanked the story-teller, and
begged him to tell more of the Hartz Mountains,
where he had spent his boyhood days.
The children were delighted when he spoke
of the gnomes, in whom he believed when he
was a child.</p>

<p>"Every time I went out in the dark woods,"
he said, "I was on the lookout for these
funny little fairies of the underground world.
I wanted to see them, but at the same time I
was afraid I should meet them.</p>

<p>"I remember one time that my mother sent
me on an errand through the woods at twilight.
I was in the thickest part of the woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
when I heard a sound that sent a shiver down
my back.</p>

<p>"'It is a witch, or some other dreadful
being,' I said to myself. 'Nothing else could
make a sound like that.' My teeth chattered.
My legs shook so, I could hardly
move. Somehow or other, I managed to
keep on. It seemed as though hours passed
before I saw the lights of the village.
Yet I suppose it was not more than fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>"When I was once more safe inside my
own home, I told my father and mother
about my fright.</p>

<p>"'It was no witch, my child,' said my
father. 'The sound you describe was probably
the cry of a wildcat. I thank Heaven
that you are safe. A wildcat is not a very
pleasant creature to meet in a lonely place.'</p>

<p>"After that, I was never sent away from
the village after dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"My boy friends and I often came across
badgers and deer, and sometimes foxes made
their way into the village in search of poultry,
but I never came nearer to meeting a wildcat
than the time of which I have just told you."</p>

<p>"What work did you do out of school
hours?" asked Hans. The boy was thinking
of the toys he had to carve.</p>

<p>"My mother raised canary-birds, and I
used to help her a great deal. Nearly every
woman in the village was busy at the same
work. What concerts we did have in those
days! Mother tended every young bird she
raised with the greatest care. Would it become
a good singer and bring a fair price?
We waited anxiously for the first notes, and
then watched to see how the voices gained in
strength and sweetness.</p>

<p>"It was a pleasant life, and I was very
happy among the birds in our little village.
Would you like to hear a song I used to sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
at that time? It is all about the birds and
bees and flowers."</p>

<p>"Do sing it for us," cried every one.</p>

<p>Herr Abel had a good voice and they
listened with pleasure to his song. This is
the first stanza:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I have been on the mountain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That the song-birds love best.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They were sitting, were flitting,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They were building their nest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They were sitting, were flitting,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They were building their nest."</span><br />
</div>


<p>After he had finished, he told about the
mines in which some of his friends worked.
It was a hard life, with no bright sunlight to
cheer the men in those deep, dark caverns
underground.</p>

<p>"Of course you all know that the deepest
mine in the world is in the Hartz Mountains."</p>

<p>His friends nodded their heads, while Hans
whispered to Bertha, "I should like to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
down in that mine just for the sake of saying
I have been as far into the earth as any living
person."</p>

<p>"The sun is setting, and there is a chill in
the air," said Bertha's father. "Let us go
home."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>WHAT THE WAVES BRING</small></h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i109.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="man and boy with house in background" />
<div class="caption">BERTHA'S HOME.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha's</span> mother had just come in from a
hard morning's work in the fields. She had
been helping her husband weed the garden.</p>

<p>She spent a great deal of time outdoors in
the summer-time, as many German peasant
women do. They do a large share of the
work in ploughing the grain-fields and harvesting
the crops. They are much stronger
than their American cousins.</p>

<p>"Supper is all ready and waiting for you,"
said Bertha.</p>

<p>The little girl had prepared a dish of sweet
fruit soup which her mother had taught her to
make.</p>

<p>"It is very good," said her father when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
had tasted it. "My little Bertha is getting
to be quite a housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is very good," said her mother.
"You learned your lesson well, my child."</p>

<p>Bertha was quite abashed by so much praise.
She looked down upon her plate and did not
lift her eyes again till Gretchen began to tell of
a new amber bracelet which had just been
given to one of the neighbours.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," said Gretchen, quite
excitedly. "The beads are such a clear,
lovely yellow. They look so pretty on Frau
Braun's neck, I don't wonder she is greatly
pleased with her present."</p>

<p>"Who sent it to her?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"Her brother in Cologne. He is doing
well at his trade, and so he bought this necklace
at a fair and sent it to his sister as a
remembrance. He wrote her a letter all about
the sights in Cologne, and asked Frau Braun
to come and visit him and his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"He promised her in the letter that if she
would come, he would take her to see the
grand Cologne cathedral. He said thousands
of strangers visit it every year, because every
one knows it is one of the most beautiful
buildings in all Europe.</p>

<p>"Then he said she should also see the
Church of Saint Ursula, where the bones of
the eleven thousand maidens can still be seen
in their glass cases."</p>

<p>"Do you know the story of St. Ursula,
Gretchen?" asked her father.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir. Ursula was the daughter
of an English king. She was about to be
married, but she said that before the wedding
she would go to Rome on a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>"Eleven thousand young girls went with
the princess. On her way home she was
married, but when the wedding party had got
as far as Cologne, they were attacked by the
savage Huns. Every one was killed,&mdash;Ursula,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
her husband, and the eleven thousand
maidens. The church was afterward built
in her memory. Ursula was made a saint by
the Pope, and the bones of the young girls
were preserved in glass cases in the church."</p>

<p>"Did Frau Braun tell of anything else her
brother wrote?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"He spoke of the bridge of boats across
the river, and said she would enjoy watching
it open and shut to let the steamers and big
rafts pass through. And he told of the
Cologne water that is sold in so many of
the shops. It is hard to tell which makes
the town most famous, the great cathedral
or the Cologne water."</p>

<p>"Father, how was the bridge of boats
made?" asked Bertha.</p>

<p>"The boats were moored in a line across
the river. Planks were then laid across the
tops and fastened upon them. Vessels cannot
pass under a bridge of this kind, so it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to be opened from time to time. They say
it is always interesting to see this done."</p>

<p>"Yes, Frau Braun said she would rather see
the bridge of boats than anything else in the
city. She has already begun to plan how she
can save up enough money to make the trip."</p>

<p>"I will go over there to-morrow to see he
new necklace," said Bertha. "But what is
amber, father?"</p>

<p>"If you should go to the northern part of
Germany, Bertha, you would see great numbers
of men, women, and children, busy on
the shores of the ocean. The work is greatest
in the rough days of autumn, when a strong
wind is blowing from the northeast.</p>

<p>"Then the men dress themselves as though
they were going out into a storm. They arm
themselves with nets and plunge into the
waves, which are bringing treasure to the
shore. It is the beautiful amber we admire
so much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"The women and children are waiting on
the sands, and as the men bring in their
nets, the contents are given into their hands.
They separate the precious lumps of amber
from the weeds to which they are clinging."</p>

<p>Their father stopped to fill his pipe, and the
children thought he had come to the end of
the story.</p>

<p>"But you haven't told us yet what amber
is," said Bertha.</p>

<p>"Be patient, my little one, and you shall
hear," replied her father, patting her head.
"As yet, I have not half told the story. But
I will answer your question at once.</p>

<p>"A long time ago, longer than you can
imagine, Bertha, forests were growing along
the shores of the Baltic Sea. There was
a great deal of gum in the trees of these
forests. It oozed out of the trees in the
same manner as gum from the spruce-tree
and resin from the pine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Storms arose, and beds of sand and clay
drifted over the forests. They were buried
away for thousands of years, it may be. But
the motion of the sea washes up pieces of
the gum, which is of light weight.</p>

<p>"The gum has become changed while
buried in the earth such a long, long time.
Wise men use the word 'fossilized' when
they speak of what has happened to it. The
now beautiful, changed gum is called amber.</p>

<p>"There are different ways of getting it. I
told you how it comes drifting in on the
waves when the winds are high and the
water is rough. But on the pleasant summer
days, when the sea is smooth and calm, the
men go out a little way from the shore in
boats. They float about, looking earnestly
over the sides of the boats to the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p>"All at once, they see something. Down
go their long hooks through the water. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
moment afterward, they begin to tow a tangle
of stones and seaweed to the shore. As soon
as they land, they begin to sort out the great
mass. Perhaps they will rejoice in finding
large pieces of amber in the collection.</p>

<p>"There is still another way of getting
amber. I know Hans will be most interested
in what I am going to say now. It has more
of danger in it, and boys like to hear anything
in the way of adventure."</p>

<p>Hans looked up and smiled. His father
knew him well. He was a daring lad. He
was always longing for the time when he
should grow up and be a soldier, and possibly
take part in some war.</p>

<p>"Children," their father went on, "you
have all heard of divers and of their dangerous
work under the sea. Gretchen was telling me
the other day about her geography lesson, and
of the pearl-divers along the shores of India.
I did not tell her then that some men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
spend their lives diving for amber on the
shores of our own country.</p>

<p>"They wear rubber suits and helmets and
air-chests of sheet iron."</p>

<p>"How can they see where they are going?"
asked Bertha.</p>

<p>"There are glass openings in their helmets,
and they can look through these. They go
out in boats. The crew generally consists of
six men. Two of them are divers, and four
men have charge of the air-pumps. These
pumps force fresh air down through tubes
fastened to the helmet of each diver. Besides
these men there is an overseer who has charge
of everything.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the divers stay for hours on
the bed of the sea, and work away at the
amber tangles."</p>

<p>"But suppose anything happens to the air-tubes
and the men fail to get as much air as
they need?" said Hans. "Is there any way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of letting those in the boat know they are in
trouble? And, besides that, how do the
others know when it is time to raise the
divers with their precious loads?"</p>

<p>"There is a safety-rope reaching from the
boat to the men. When they pull this rope
it is a sign that they wish to be drawn up.
But I have told you as much about amber
now as you will be able to remember."</p>

<p>"Are you very tired, father dear?" said
Bertha, in her most coaxing tone.</p>

<p>"Why should I be tired? What do you
wish to ask me? Come, speak out plainly,
little one."</p>

<p>"You tell such lovely fairy-tales, papa, I
was just wishing for one. See! The moon
is just rising above the tree-tops. It is the
very time for stories of the wonderful beings."</p>

<p>Her father smiled. "It shall be as you
wish, Bertha. It is hard to refuse you when
you look at me that way. Come, children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
let us sit in the doorway. Goodwife, put
down your work and join us while I tell
the story of Siegfried, the old hero of
Germany."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>THE MAGIC SWORD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Far</span> away in the long ago there lived a
mighty king with his goodwife and his brave
son, Siegfried. Their home was at Xanten,
where the river Rhine flows lazily along.</p>

<p>The young prince was carefully taught.
But when his education was nearly finished,
his father said:</p>

<p>"Siegfried, there is a mighty smith named
Mimer. It will be well for you to learn all
you can of him in regard to the making of
arms."</p>

<p>So Siegfried went to work at the trade of
a smith. It was not long before he excelled
his teacher. This pleased Mimer, who spent
many spare hours with his pupil, telling him
stories of the olden times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>After awhile, he took Siegfried into his
confidence. He said:</p>

<p>"There is a powerful knight in Burgundy
who has challenged every smith of my country
to make a weapon strong enough to pierce
his coat of mail.</p>

<p>"I long to try," Mimer went on, "but I
am now old and have not strength enough to
use the heavy hammer."</p>

<p>At these words Siegfried jumped up in
great excitement.</p>

<p>"I will make the sword, dear master," he
cried. "Be of good cheer. It shall be strong
enough to cut the knight's armour in two."</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Siegfried began
his work. For seven days and seven nights
the constant ringing of his hammer could be
heard. At the end of that time Siegfried
came to his master with a sword of the finest
steel in his right hand.</p>

<p>Mimer looked it all over. He then held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
it in a stream of running water in which he
had thrown a fine thread. The water carried
the thread against the edge of the sword,
where it was cut in two.</p>

<p>"It is without a fault," cried Mimer with
delight.</p>

<p>"I can do better than that," answered
Siegfried, and he took the sword and broke
it into pieces.</p>

<p>Again he set to work. For seven more
days and seven more nights he was busy at
his forge. At the end of that time he brought
a polished sword to his master.</p>

<p>Mimer looked it over with the greatest care
and made ready to test it.</p>

<p>He threw the fleeces of twelve sheep into
the stream. The current carried them on its
bosom to Siegfried's sword. Instantly, each
piece was divided as it met the blade. Mimer
shouted aloud in his joy.</p>

<p>"Balmung" (for that was the name Siegfried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
gave the sword) "is the finest weapon man ever
made," he cried.</p>

<p>Siegfried was now prepared to meet the
proud knight of Burgundy.</p>

<p>The very first thrust of the sword, Balmung,
did the work. The head and shoulders
of the giant were severed from the rest of the
body. They rolled down the hillside and fell
into the Rhine, where they can be seen even
now, when the water is clear. At least, so
runs the story. The trunk remained on the
hilltop and was turned to stone.</p>

<p>Soon after this Mimer found that Siegfried
longed to see the world and make himself
famous. So he bound the sword Balmung
to the young prince's side, and told him to
seek a certain person, who would give him a
fine war-horse.</p>

<p>Siegfried went to this man, from whom he
obtained a matchless steed. In fact it had
descended from the great god Odin's magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
horse. Siegfried, you can see, must have
lived in a time when men believed in gods
and other wonderful beings.</p>

<p>He was now all ready for his adventures,
but before starting out, Mimer told him of
a great treasure of gold guarded by a fearful
serpent. This treasure was spread out over a
plain called the Glittering Heath. No man
had yet been able to take it, because of its
terrible guardian.</p>

<p>Siegfried was not in the least frightened by
the stories he heard of the monster. He
started out on his dangerous errand with a
heart full of courage.</p>

<p>At last, he drew near the plain. He could
see it on the other side of the Rhine, from the
hilltop where he was standing. With no one
to help him, not even taking his magic horse
with him, he hurried down the hillside and
sprang into a boat on the shore.</p>

<p>An old man had charge of the boat, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
he rowed Siegfried across, he gave him good
advice. This old man, as it happened, was
the god Odin, who loved Siegfried and wished
to see him succeed.</p>

<p>"Dig a deep trench along the path the
serpent has worn on his way to the river when
in search of water," said the old boatman.
"Hide yourself in the trench, and, as the
serpent passes along, you must thrust your
sword deep into his body."</p>

<p>It was good advice. Siegfried did as Odin
directed him. He went to work on the trench
at once. It was soon finished, and then the
young prince, sword in hand, was lying in
watch for the dread monster.</p>

<p>He did not have long to wait. He soon
heard the sound of rolling stones. Then
came a loud hiss, and immediately afterward
he felt the serpent's fiery breath on his cheek.</p>

<p>And now the serpent rolled over into the
ditch, and Siegfried was covered by the folds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of his huge body. He did not fear or falter.
He thrust Balmung, his wonderful sword,
deep into the monster's body. The blood
poured forth in such torrents that the ditch
began to fill fast.</p>

<p>It was a time of great danger for Siegfried.
He would have been drowned if the serpent
in his death-agony had not rolled over on
one side and given him a chance to free
himself.</p>

<p>In a moment more he was standing, safe
and sound, by the side of the ditch. His
bath in the serpent's blood had given him a
great blessing. Hereafter it would be impossible
for any one to wound him except in
one tiny place on his shoulder. A leaf had
fallen on this spot, and the blood had not
touched it.</p>

<p>"What did Siegfried do with the golden
treasure?" asked Hans, when his father had
reached this point in the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"He had not sought it for himself, but
for Mimer's sake. All he cared for was the
power of killing the serpent."</p>

<p>As soon as this was done, Mimer drew near
and showed himself ungrateful and untrue.
He was so afraid Siegfried would claim some
of the treasure that he secretly drew Balmung
from out the serpent's body, and made ready
to thrust it into Siegfried.</p>

<p>But at that very moment his foot slipped in
the monster's blood, and he fell upon the
sword and was instantly killed.</p>

<p>Siegfried was filled with horror when he saw
what had happened. He sprang upon his
horse's back and fled as fast as possible from
the dreadful scene.</p>

<p>"What happened to Siegfried after that?
Did he have any more adventures?" asked
Bertha.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. There were enough to fill
a book. But there is one in particular you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
girls would like to hear. It is about a beautiful
princess whom he freed from a spell which
had been cast upon her."</p>

<p>"What was her name, papa?" asked
Gretchen.</p>

<p>"Brunhild, the Queen of Isenland. She
had been stung by the thorn of sleep."</p>

<p>Odin, the great god, had said, "Brunhild
shall not awake till some hero is brave enough
to fight his way through the flames which
shall constantly surround the palace. He
must then go to the side of the sleeping
maiden and break the charm by a kiss upon
her forehead."</p>

<p>When Siegfried, in his wanderings, heard
the story of Brunhild, he said, "I will make
my way through the flames and will myself
rescue the fair princess."</p>

<p>He leaped upon the back of his magic
steed, and together they fought their way
through the fire that surrounded the palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the sleeping beauty. He reached the gates
in safety. There was no sign of life about the
place. Every one was wrapped in a deep
sleep.</p>

<p>Siegfried made his way to the room of the
enchanted princess. Ah! there she lay, still
and beautiful, with no knowledge of what was
going on around her.</p>

<p>The young knight knelt by her side.
Leaning over her, he pressed a kiss upon her
forehead. She moved slightly; then, opening
her blue eyes, she smiled sweetly upon her
deliverer.</p>

<p>At the same moment every one else in the
palace woke up and went on with whatever
had been interrupted when sleep overcame
them.</p>

<p>Siegfried remained for six months with the
fair Brunhild and her court. Every day was
given up to music and feasting, games and
songs. Time passed like a beautiful dream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
No one knows how long the young knight
might have enjoyed this happy life if Odin
had not sent two birds, Thought and Memory,
to remind him there were other things for
him yet to do.</p>

<p>He did not stop to bid Brunhild farewell,
but leaped upon his horse's back and rode
away in search of new adventures.</p>

<p>"Dear me, children," exclaimed their father,
looking at the clock, "it is long past the time
you should be in your soft, warm beds."</p>

<p>"Papa, do you know what day to-morrow
is?" whispered Bertha, as she kissed him
good night.</p>

<p>"My darling child's birthday. It is ten
years to-morrow since your eyes first looked
upon the sunlight. They have been ten
happy years to us all, though our lives are full
of work. What do you say to that, my little
one?"</p>

<p>"Very happy, papa dear. You and mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
are so kind! I ought to be good as well
as happy."</p>

<p>"She is a faithful child," said her mother,
after Bertha had left the room. "That is why
I have a little surprise ready for to-morrow.
I have baked a large birthday cake and shall
ask her little friends to share it with her.</p>

<p>"Her aunt has finished the new dress I
bought for her, and I have made two white
aprons, besides. She will be a happy child
when she sees her presents."</p>

<p>The mother closed her eyes and made a
silent prayer to the All-Father that Bertha's
life should be as joyful as her tenth birthday
gave promise of being.</p>
